​In this analysis, we performed a comprehensive examination of sales data to extract actionable business insights. Here's an overview of the methodologies and findings:​

Date Parsing and Temporal Aggregation:

The ORDER DATE field, stored as text in the format %m/%d/%Y %H:%i, was converted into a proper DATETIME format using the STR_TO_DATE() function.

Post conversion, we extracted the Year, Quarter, and Month using the YEAR(), QUARTER(), and MONTH() functions respectively.

This enabled aggregation of SALES data over different time periods, facilitating trend analysis over months, quarters, and years.​

Product Line Performance Analysis:

By grouping data by PRODUCTLINE and calculating total sales, we identified the most and least selling product lines.

This information is crucial for inventory management and marketing strategies.​

Geographical Sales Distribution:

Sales data was aggregated by COUNTRY and TERRITORY to understand regional performance.

Identifying top-performing regions helps in strategic planning and resource allocation.​

Customer Insights:

Grouping sales data by CUSTOMERNAME allowed us to pinpoint customers contributing the most to revenue.

Calculating the average sales per order provided insights into typical transaction sizes, aiding in customer segmentation and targeting strategies.​

Data Validation and Schema Understanding:

The DESCRIBE statement was used to review the structure of the sales data table, ensuring accurate query formulation and understanding of data types.​

Overall, this analysis serves as a robust tool for sales data examination, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions by uncovering trends, identifying key markets, and understanding customer behaviors.
